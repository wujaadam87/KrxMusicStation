# KrxMusicStation
ASP.NET Core web interface for Kodi music database to provide a search by text functionality with Yamaha RN303d network receiver.

A web application to create playlists out of music stored on the server's (laptop's) disc.
The playlists are saved to folder, from which Yamaha device can playback - this mechanism is enabled via Kodi app
(which serves as local wi-fi media server).
Additionally it splits music files that are saved as one file with a cuesheet describing its tracks,
as Yamaha receiver cannot read the cursheet but single files.

# Search panel:
The krx app enables for easy search-by-text & create playlist functionality.
The search-result list is dynamically updated, previewed in ranges (e.g. 1-50, 51-100 etc.),
can be sorted per artist, album, song name, bitrate, duration etc.
Quality search criterium is included:
- lossless (more than 320 kbps),
- high quality (more than 192),
- any quality.
User can select the songs from the search results list and move them to the edited playlist.

# Playlist panel:
User can either edit the default playlist (blank from the start), or chose existing playlist for editing.
When finished, user can either save the edited playlist, or save as (new or some existing playlist).
During saving for one-file-per-album files it extracts single tracks from the single file and saves them to a temp folder,
the single files are then used by the playlists.
Otherwise Yamaha device is not able to playback single tracks from the one-file-per-album.
